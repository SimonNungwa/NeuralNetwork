 Football Game Prediction Neural Network

This repository contains a neural network designed to predict the outcomes of football games. The project leverages historical match data to train a model capable of forecasting future match results.

 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a neural network using Python that predicts the outcome of football games (win, lose, or draw). The network is trained on historical football match data, including various features such as team statistics, player performance, and other relevant factors.

 Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To train the neural network and predict football game outcomes, run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```


## Data

The data used for training the model should include historical football match results with relevant features. Place raw data files in the `data/raw` directory. Use `src/data_loader.py` to preprocess the data and save the processed files in `data/processed`.
